# Streaming Locator
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
Movie finder

The application allows a user to search for various movies and television shows and access their trailers, streaming services and information about the movie such as cast and reviews.
Within the applications we used two separate api functions through watchmode and omdb, using these api's we gathered information about the searched title and were able to display it with some JavaScript wizardry. We also used local storage to store and display previous searches.
 
User Story:
    As a person that wants to know more information about a movie and where to watch it
    I WANT to create a website that allows one to search for movies
    SO THAT I can have all the information in one place rather than search for all the information from different sources.
